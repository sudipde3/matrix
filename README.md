# Matrix
Let A be a 𝑀 𝑋 𝑁 matrix.
1. Write a program for computing mean, SD, Min and Max of A.
2. Create a new matrix 𝐵 from 𝐴 such that 𝐵=(𝐴−𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛)/𝑆𝐷
    //note this has to be implemented elementwise or pixel wise.
   This operation is widely used for normalization of data.
4. Create a new matrix C from 𝐴 such that 𝐶=(𝐴−𝑀𝑖𝑛)/(𝑀𝑎𝑥−𝑀𝑖𝑛) ∗ 100
   // note this has to be implemented elementwise or pixel wise.
   This operation is widely used for normalization of data.
5. Create a matrix 𝐷 from A such that 𝐷 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐴)
   //note this has to be implemented elementwise or pixel wise.
6. Create a matrix 𝐸 from 𝐴, such that elements of even rows are equal to 1.
